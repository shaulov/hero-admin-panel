## About the project
- The project is homework from udemy course (www.udemy.com/course/javascript_full)
- This is simple admin panel with using React and Redux

## What I did

- Interaction with database (heroes.json)
- Additional functions (filter, animation and etc.)
- Transition from Redux to RTK and then partially to RTK Query
